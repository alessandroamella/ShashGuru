# ShashGuru

A chess analyzer that takes a FEN or PGN and asks an LLM to analyse it.



##### Platforms

It should work with Unix and Windows.

Please open an issue if it doesn't. 

### Usage
Build and run from docker-compose-vllm.yml
I provide a shell script on linux for starting it: "refreshDockers.sh"
